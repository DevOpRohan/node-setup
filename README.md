**Note**: this guide assumes your machine is running Ubuntu, that you have
`sudo` privileges, that you've bought a proper Domain Name and are pointing it
at the Public IP Address of your machine.

### Installation

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kadena-community/node-setup/master/installnode.sh

And follow the instructions.

A log of the install is stored in `/tmp/install.log` if there were any errors.
